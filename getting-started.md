### Scalar built-in types
```
int - arbitrary precision integer
float - 64-bit floating point numbers
    53 bits of binary precision
    15 to 16 bits of decimal precision
None - the null object
bool - boolean logical values
```
- - -
### Relational Operators
```
==  value equality / equivalence
!=  value inequality / inequivalence
<   less-than
>   greater-than
<=  less-than or equal to
>=  greater-than or equal to
```
- - -
### Conditional Statements
```
if expr:
    print("expr is True")
else:
    print("expr is False")
```
*expr is convert to bool as if by
the bool() constructor*

### Bitwise Operations on Integer Types
```
x | y 	bitwise or of x and y
x ^ y 	bitwise exclusive or of x and y
x & y 	bitwise and of x and y
x << n 	x shifted left by n bits
x >> n 	x shifted right by n bits
~x 	the bits of x inverted
```
